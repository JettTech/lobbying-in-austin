# lobbying-in-Austin

Visualization of Austin lobbyist registrations.

Our plan is to take [lobbyist registration data from data.austintexas.gov](https://data.austintexas.gov/dataset/Lobbyists/bqav-9x6a), convert it to show cumulative lobbyists hired by various organizations on different dates, and make a visualization in D3.js.

There are probably still significant errors in our modified version of the dataset. If you need accuracy, please get your data directly from data.austintexas.gov for now.
